DownThemAll!
==================

The first and only download manager/accelerator built inside Firefox!

Developing
-------------------

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Setting_up_extension_development_environment
Just clone the repository and use an extension proxy file. No additional build step required.

- Pull requests welcome. By submitting code you agree to license it under MPL v2 unless explicitly specified otherwise. 
- Please stick to the general coding style.
- Please also always add unit tests for all new js modules and new module functions.
- Unit tests for UI (overlays) aren't required at the moment, but welcome. There is currently no infrastructure to run those, though.

Building an XPI
-------------------

See `make.py`.

Important bits of code
-------------------

- `modules/glue.jsm` - This is basically the main module, also specifying the general environment for all modules and window scopes.
- `modules/main.js` - General setup.
- `modules/loaders/` - "overlay" scripts. Different to traditional Firefox add-ons, DownThemAll! does not use real overlays and overlay scripts, but kind of simulates overlays via modules.
- `chrome/content/` - UI. Right now, due to historical reasons and some too-tight coupling the UI JS also contains some of the important data structures such as `QueueItem` (representing a single queued download)

- Please note that being restartless requires code to clean up after itself, i.e. if you modify something global you need to reverse the modifications when the add-on is unloaded. See `unload()`and `unloadWindow()` (in glue.jsm and/or support/overlays.js)
- Please make use of the niceties Firefox JS (ES6) and of the global helpers from glue.jsm, in particular:
  - `for of` loops
  - Sets and (weak) maps
  - generators
  - comprehensions and destructoring assignment
  - `Object.freeze()`, `Object.defineProperties()`, etc.
  - `log()`
  - `lazy()`/`lazyProto()`
  - `Services` and `Instances`
  
  
## Fork Motivation

This fork has the aim to migrate the code base from legacy Firefox to the new WebExtensions technology.
